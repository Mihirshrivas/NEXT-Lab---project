   Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Visual Studio Code (Optional):**
   While not required, you can use Visual Studio Code for a convenient development environment. Download and install it from the [official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal in the directory containing the Python script (`extract_numbers.py`).
   - Run the script using the command:
     ```bash
